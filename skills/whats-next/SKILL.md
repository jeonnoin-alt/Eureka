description: Use when a researcher is stuck, unsure of the next step, feels lost in the middle of a project, or asks any variant of "what should I do next?", "where am I?", "what now?", "I'm stuck" — diagnoses research state and recommends which Eureka skill to invoke next

# What's Next?

## Overview

Researchers get stuck. Not because they're lazy or incompetent — because the research lifecycle has many branches, every project has different state, and "what should I do now?" is a hard question even for experienced PIs.

This skill diagnoses **where you are in the research lifecycle**, then recommends the next Eureka skill to invoke. It does NOT do the work itself. It is a router — it figures out which specialist to call.

**Core principle:** When stuck, the answer is almost never "try harder at what you're doing." The answer is usually "you're in a different phase than you think — switch tools."

## When to Use

**Use this skill when:**
- The user says any variant of "what now?", "what should I do next?", "I'm stuck", "어디서부터 손대야 하지", "어디쯤이지"
- The user describes ambiguous progress without a clear next step
- The user has been spinning on the same task for an unusually long time
- The user asks for general advice rather than a specific operation
- The user just finished a phase but doesn't say what they're moving to

**Do NOT use this skill when:**
- The user has a specific request — go to the matching specialist skill directly
- The user is in active execution and just needs to keep going
- The user is asking for help with a single concrete task (use the relevant specific skill)

## Core Principle: Diagnose, Don't Solve

This skill **never executes the actual research work**. It always ends with a recommendation to invoke another Eureka skill. If you find yourself starting to brainstorm a hypothesis, troubleshoot a result, or write a manuscript while in this skill — STOP. You skipped the handoff.

The job of `whats-next` is to answer one question: **"Which Eureka skill should I invoke right now?"**

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these and complete them in order:

1. **Scan project state** — read project files to determine objective state
2. **Identify most recent activity** — what was the last thing the user finished or attempted?
3. **Ask diagnostic questions** — one at a time, as needed to disambiguate
4. **Map to research lifecycle phase** — name the phase the user is currently in
5. **Recommend 2-3 next actions** — each linked to a specific Eureka skill
6. **Hand off** — user picks one, then invoke that skill

## Step 1: Scan Project State

Before asking anything, scan the project files to gather objective evidence:

| Look for | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| `docs/eureka/designs/*.md` | A research design exists → past brainstorming phase |
| `docs/eureka/registrations/*.md` | Hypothesis is registered → past hypothesis-first phase |
| `docs/eureka/plans/*.md` | Experiment plan exists → past experiment-design phase |
| `results/` directory with files | Experiments have been run |
| `docs/eureka/records/experiment-log.md` | Structured experiment tracking exists |
| `docs/eureka/audits/*.md` | Claims have been audited |
| `docs/eureka/journal/*.md` (most recent) | Narrative context from last session — decisions, failures, blockers, and the "Next session starts with" hint. This is your strongest continuity signal. |
| Recent `git log` (last 5–10 commits) | What the user actually did most recently |
| `*.tex`, `manuscript/`, `paper/` | Manuscript writing is in progress |
| `notes/` or other free-form files | Additional free-form thinking that may reveal context |

If the project does not use Eureka conventions yet (no `docs/eureka/` structure), the user is likely at the very beginning. That is its own diagnosis — the answer will probably be `eureka:research-brainstorming`.

## Step 2: Identify Most Recent Activity

Look at the latest commits, the newest files in `results/`, the most recently modified document. State what you found:

> "I see your most recent activity: 3 baseline experiment results in `results/run_20260411_*/`, last commit was `Run baseline model` from 2 days ago. The design doc exists but no review report yet."

This is not an interpretation — it is a factual report. The user can correct it if you read the state wrong.

**If `docs/eureka/journal/` exists**, read the most recent entry (latest date file, last `##` session block within it). The `Next session starts with` field is your strongest single signal for what to recommend — it is a message from past-user to future-user specifically about the next action. Quote it back to the user:

> "Your last journal entry (2026-03-22, 18:00 session) says next session starts with: 'Re-run Model A with per-subject normalization'. Is that still the right starting point, or has anything changed since?"

The journal also surfaces `Blockers` and `Failed attempts` from prior sessions, which tell you what to avoid recommending.

## Step 3: Ask Diagnostic Questions

Ask **one at a time**. Stop as soon as you have enough information to recommend.

The four core questions (skip any that are already answered by Step 1 or by the conversation):

1. **What was the most recent thing you finished or attempted?**
2. **What was the outcome?** (multiple choice: success / partial success / failure / unclear / haven't checked yet)
3. **What is blocking you from moving forward?** (multiple choice if possible: missing information / unclear interpretation / decision paralysis / waiting on external / lost confidence in approach / other)
4. **If a senior collaborator walked in right now, what would you ask them?**

Optional follow-ups when needed:
- "Are these results aligned with what your registered hypothesis predicted, or different?"
- "Have you written down what you expect the next experiment to show?"
- "Is the issue technical (something broke) or interpretive (you don't know what the result means)?"

## Step 4: Map to Research Lifecycle Phase

Based on Steps 1–3, identify which phase the user is in. Use this map:

| State | Phase | Recommend |
|---|---|---|
| No design doc, **no research question at all** — only keywords, a dataset, or vague interest (e.g., "something with EEG") | **Pre-ideation** | `eureka:research-ideation` |
| No design doc, **has a research question** but it needs refinement (e.g., "Does X cause Y?") | **Pre-design** | `eureka:research-brainstorming` |
| Design exists, no registration, no analysis | **Pre-registration** | `eureka:hypothesis-first` |
| Hypothesis registered, no experiment plan | **Pre-execution planning** | `eureka:experiment-design` |
| Experiment plan exists, no results | **Execution** | Just run the experiments — no skill needed yet |
| Some results, but mixed/unclear/unexpected | **Investigation** | `eureka:systematic-troubleshooting` (if technical) OR `eureka:requesting-research-review` (if interpretive) |
| Results complete, not yet evaluated | **Phase review** | `eureka:requesting-research-review` |
| Review passed, starting to write | **Manuscript drafting** | `eureka:claims-audit` (use during writing, not just at the end) |
| Manuscript drafted | **Pre-publication audit** | `eureka:claims-audit` then `eureka:verification-before-publication` |
| Verification passed | **Submission decision** | `eureka:submission-readiness` |
| Pivoting / lost direction | **Re-design** | `eureka:research-brainstorming` (start over with new question) |

If the user's state spans multiple phases, pick the **earliest unfinished one**. You cannot skip Phase N to get to Phase N+1.

**Discriminating rule for Pre-ideation vs Pre-design:** If the user can state the question as "Does/Is/Can [X] [verb] [Y]?", they have a formed question → Pre-design. If they cannot, they are in Pre-ideation.

## Step 5: Recommend 2-3 Next Actions

Present the recommendations in this format:

```
You are currently in: [phase name]

Most likely next actions:

1. [Recommended] Invoke `eureka:[skill-name]` — [one-sentence rationale]
2. Alternative: Invoke `eureka:[other-skill]` — [when this is the better choice]
3. Optional: [non-skill action, e.g., "wait for collaborator response"]

Which one?
```

Lead with **one** clear recommendation. The alternatives exist for cases where the user has context you don't.

## Step 6: Hand Off

After the user picks, invoke the chosen skill via the `Skill` tool. Do NOT try to do that skill's job inside `whats-next`.

If the user picks the recommended skill, just invoke it. If they pick an alternative, invoke that one — they have context you don't.

After the hand-off, gently remind the user:

> "At the end of this session, `eureka:research-journal` can capture today's decisions and what to start with next time."

This is a soft reminder, not a requirement. The user decides whether to journal at session end.

## Output Format

Total response length: **short**. This is a triage skill, not a coaching session. Aim for:

- 2–3 sentences of state report
- 1 question (if any are needed)
- 2–3 line recommendation
- Hand off

Long outputs defeat the purpose. The user is stuck. They need a direction, not a lecture.

## Anti-Patterns

| What you might do wrong | What to do instead |
|---|---|
| Start brainstorming the next experiment | Stop. Recommend `eureka:research-brainstorming` and hand off. |
| Diagnose technical bugs in the data | Stop. Recommend `eureka:systematic-troubleshooting` and hand off. |
| Critique the user's research direction | Stop. The right skill for evaluation is `eureka:requesting-research-review`. |
| Write a long motivational/coaching response | Triage is fast and factual. Save the empathy for a different conversation. |
| Recommend more than 3 actions | Decision paralysis is part of the problem. Narrow it down. |
| Skip the project state scan | Without scanning, your recommendation is a guess. Always scan first. |
| Recommend a skill the user has clearly already done | Read the project state. If they registered a hypothesis already, do not tell them to register one. |
| Treat this as a brainstorming session | This skill is a router. The brainstorming happens in `eureka:research-brainstorming`. |

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP — you're slipping out of triage mode:

- "Let me just suggest one quick experiment" → No. Recommend the skill.
- "I'll explain why their result is unexpected" → No. Recommend `systematic-troubleshooting`.
- "Let me draft the manuscript section for them" → No. Recommend `claims-audit`.
- "I should give them a deeper analysis of their situation" → No. Triage is short.
- "They probably know all this — let me just tell them what to do" → Scan first. You may be wrong.

## Common Stuck States

These are the most frequent stuck states researchers experience and the typical correct routing:

| Stuck state | Likely phase | Skill to recommend |
|---|---|---|
| "Baseline done, results are mixed" | Phase review | `requesting-research-review` to evaluate rigor before drawing conclusions |
| "I have an idea but don't know how to test it" | Pre-design | `research-brainstorming` |
| "Experiment crashed and I don't know why" | Execution → Investigation | `systematic-troubleshooting` |
| "The numbers look right but feel wrong" | Investigation | `systematic-troubleshooting` (Phase 1: investigate) |
| "Reviewer said X, not sure how to respond" | Post-review | `receiving-research-review` |
| "I think I'm done but not sure" | Pre-publication | `verification-before-publication` |
| "Should I keep going or pivot?" | Decision | `submission-readiness` (the four-option gate) |
| "I have results but no plan to write them up" | Drafting | Start writing, then `claims-audit` |
| "I haven't touched this in weeks, where was I?" | Any | Scan state, recommend the next gate |
| "I keep going in circles on the same analysis" | Investigation OR re-design | `systematic-troubleshooting` first; if 3+ attempts failed, escalate to `research-brainstorming` |
| "I have data but don't know what to study" | Pre-ideation | `research-ideation` |
| "What interesting questions are there in this field?" | Pre-ideation | `research-ideation` |
| "The figure looks wrong / won't pass journal review" | Writing / submission prep | `figure-design` |
| "I need to make a figure for Results" | Writing | `figure-design` (after results are finalized) |
| "Results are technically fine but the paper feels flat" | Writing / pre-submission | `manuscript-writing` narrative-arc lock step (Discovery-Adjusted Framing) with `docs/references/narrative-guide.md` section **"Discovery-Adjusted Framing"** |
| "Not sure if this is Nature-level or specialty-journal-level" | Submission prep | `submission-readiness` venue-framing check with `narrative-guide.md` section **"Venue-specific altitude tuning"** |

## Integration

- **Called by:** `eureka:using-eureka` when the user expresses being stuck or asks "what next?"
- **Invokes:** Any other Eureka skill (this is a dispatcher)
- **Pairs with:** Every other Eureka skill — this is the front door when the user can't pick one themselves
- **Does NOT replace:** Any specific skill. It always hands off.

## Skill Type

**FLEXIBLE** — The diagnostic conversation adapts to context. The order and depth of questions can change based on what the project state already reveals. The constant is the structure: scan → identify → diagnose → map → recommend → hand off.

This is a router skill. Routers do not solve problems — they make sure the right specialist gets called. Discipline here means resisting the urge to "just help" inside the router itself.
